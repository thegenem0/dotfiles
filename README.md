# Personal configuration files

## NeoVim config

- Basic editor config located in `gergon02/core`
- Plugins in `gergon02/plugins`

### Some plugins require some external libraries/binaries:

- LSP needs a C compiler (gcc on Linux, MinGW or similar for Windows)
- Telescope needs ripgrep
- Treesitter needs the `tree-sitter-cli` node package
- Telescope may need fzf installed as a binary
